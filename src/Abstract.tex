    Real-time systems have various requirements such as deadline and resource constraints.
    These systems are becoming larger and more complex, and study on performance analysis and efficient scheduling algorithms is becoming more important.
    A directed acyclic graph (DAG) model that can express task dependencies and parallelism is used for such studies.
    DAG researchers use a random DAG set to demonstrate the effectiveness and objectivity of their proposed method.
    However, there is no random DAG generation tool that can generate a DAG set that considers the latest multi-rate systems.
    Therefore, researchers must generate random DAGs on their own, which leads to secondary labor and reduced reliability and reproducibility.
    To solve this problem, We propose a multi-rate DAG generator (MRDAG-Gen) that considers the constraints and configurations of state-of-the-art multi-rate systems.
    MRDAG-Gen also provides batch generation of random DAG sets with different parameters.
    The case study shows that MRDAG-Gen covers various problem settings and DAG study requirements.
