\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec: conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a random DAG generator considering multi-rate applications for reproducible scheduling evaluation called RD-Gen that can generate both single-rate DAGs and state-of-the-art multi-rate DAGs.
RD-Gen extended the existing random graph generation methods for DAGs and provided a new chain-based method.
RD-Gen could automatically set complex properties such as CCR and the total utilization.
Moreover, RD-Gen could support researchers by providing functions such as the batch generation of a given number of DAG sets for different parameters.
Case studies indicated that RD-Gen could meet the requirements of DAG studies in a variety of problem settings.
Therefore, RD-Gen can provide reliability and easy reproducibility for DAG studies.
In future work, we plan to extend RD-Gen to cover additional graph generation methods and more complex properties.
