\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec: conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a multi-rate DAG generator called MRDAG-Gen that can generate both single-rate DAGs and state-of-the-art multi-rate DAGs.
MRDAG-Gen extends the existing random graph generation methods for DAGs and provides a new chain-based method.
MRDAG-Gen can automatically set complex properties such as CCR and the total utilization.
Moreover, MRDAG-Gen can support researchers by providing functions such as the batch generation of a given number of DAG sets for different parameters.
Case studies indicate that MRDAG-Gen can meet the requirements of DAG studies in a variety of problem settings.
Therefore, MRDAG-Gen can provide reliability and easy reproducibility for DAG studies.
In future work, we plan to extend MRDAG-Gen to cover additional graph generation methods and more complex properties.
