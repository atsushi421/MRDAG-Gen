\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a multi-rate DAG generator MRDAG-Gen that covers single-rate DAGs and state-of-the-art multi-rate DAGs.
MRDAG-Gen extended the existing random graph generation method for DAGs and also provided a new chain-based method.
MRDAG-Gen automatically set complex properties such as CCR and utilization.
Moreover, MRDAG-Gen supported researchers by providing functions such as batch generation of all DAG sets for different parameters.
Case studies showed that MRDAG-Gen meets the requirements of DAG studies in a variety of problem settings.
Therefore, MRDAG-Gen provided reliability and easy reproducibility for DAG studies.
In future work, We plan to extend MRDAG-Gen to cover more graph generation methods and complex properties.
