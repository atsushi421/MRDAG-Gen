\section{Evaluation using case study}
\label{sec: evaluation_case_study}

% Multi-rate DAGs consisting of only timer-driven nodes are considered for real-time applications such as in-vehicle systems and automated driving systems.
% In the evaluation of such studies of DAGs, a random set of DAGs with different total utilization is used \cite{yang2020mixed, nogd2020response, agrawal2020hard, gunzel2021suspension}.
% An example of a YAML file and the generated DAG for a random task set using the {G(n, p)} method with total utilization varying from 0.05 to 1.0, the period from 1 to 1000, and the number of nodes from 5 to 100 is shown in Fig.~\ref{}.
